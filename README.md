# Agentic Memory

This is a simple Agentic Memory project built on top of a RAG system.

The system provides a cloud-agnostic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline that runs on Kubernetes, designed to ingest PDFs, extract text via OCR, chunk documents, generate embeddings, and provide retrieval APIs for downstream consumers.

For detailed requirements, architecture, and implementation plans, see [Plan.md](Plan.md).
